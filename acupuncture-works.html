            <h2>Here's what our clients are saying about our work...</h2>
            
            <p>"I am writing this testimonial with gratitude for the treatment that you gave me over a period in 2005. When I presented myself to you I was suffering from extreme fatigue. 
            I had quite chronic pain in my left knee. You gave me treatment for my sickness on Fridays for about 8 weeks in succession. The outcome was so positive that I was able to commence my goal learning Taoist Tai Ch’I in a beginners class in August 2005. I found you to be a very considerate and highly professional therapist whom I would emphatically recommend to any person who may be seeking wellness and health. 
            I thank you very sincerely for the gift that you gave me of a "new lease of life" - <strong>Peter J.F.</strong></p>
            <hr />
            <p>"Thank you for all that you have done to help me. When I first came to see you I was not at all well. I had no energy, was sleeping badly and generally feeling terrible. 
            Now I feel wonderful and have energy to spare! Thanks to your herbals, acupuncture, care and interest." - <strong>Ann H</strong></p>
            <hr />
            <p>"I really want to say a HUGE thank you for all you have done for me. I was told I had a high possibility of not conceiving a child due to a history of endometriosis. After seeing you for 10 months I fell pregnant. 
            I continued acupuncture throughout my pregnancy and all thanks to you Jane, I gave birth to the most beautiful baby girl 8 weeks ago. Thank you oh so very very much."" -<strong>Stella</strong></p>
            <hr />
            <p>"I thank you for making my legs better. Before I came to you my legs were stiff and I was in pain a lot. Now the pain has gone. I have much more flexibility. I can even do the splits." -<strong> Vanessa J</strong></p>
            <hr />
            <p>"Henry, thank you so much for all the acupuncture you have given me on my knee and groin. It has really helped to keep me running." - <strong>Claire S</strong></p>
