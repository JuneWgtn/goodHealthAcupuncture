            <h3 id="question1">What is Traditional Chinese Medicine?</h3>
            <p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a system of medicine used to diagnose and treat illnesses, prevent disease and improve well-being. It is effective for physical, psychological and emotional conditions.</p>
            <p>It has been used in China for the past 3000 years and is now widely practiced throughout the world.</p>
            <p>
                TCM sees disease as an imbalance in the flow of energy (Ch'i). When energy becomes blocked there is an imbalance, which manifests as disease. TCM aims to identify where there is an imbalance and uses methods
                such as acupuncture and herbs to help the body restore itself to a state of relative balance.
            </p>
            <p>
                TCM aims at treating the whole person rather than just the disease. It takes into account not only physical but also mental and emotional aspects to develop a complete picture of the patient.
                It looks at treating the root patterns or disharmony rather than simply treating the symptoms of disease.
            </p>
            <p>TCM has always been used as a preventative medicine, as a way of maintaining health, but can bring great benefits to the patient in almost any illness.</p>
            <h3 id="question2">How does acupuncture work?</h3>
            <p>
                According to ancient Chinese medical theory, the life force called Ch'i flows through the body through invisible channels (called meridians), regulating physical and mental processes. Opposing forces within the body,
                called Yin and Yang, must be balanced to keep Ch'i flowing properly. The meridians run deep within the body's tissues and organs, surfacing at some 360 places identified as acupuncture points.
                Stimulating these points balances and restores the flow of Ch'i.
            </p>
            <h3 id="question3">Is acupuncture painful?</h3>
            <p>You may feel sensations of numbness, tingling, warmth or coolness in various areas of the body, which are all normal. Your practitioner can explain why.</p>
            <h3 id="question4">What happens during treatments?</h3>
            <p>When you come in for treatment, up to ½ hour could be spent discussing not only the immediate problem but also taking a full case history to build up a picture of your health.</p>
            <p>Not only will the practitioner spend time asking questions relevant to your condition but also he or she will use the tools of pulse taking and tongue diagnosis to gain more of an understanding of your condition.</p>
            <h3 id="question5">Are needles safe?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Each needle is used once only. They are prepackaged, sterile, stainless steel and are immediately disposed after use.</p>
            <h3 id="question6">How does Chinese herbal medicine work?</h3>
            <p>
                Chinese herbal medicine is very popular in China. It is used to treat illnesses from unusual weather changes, emotional disturbances, physical overwork, an unbalanced diet, medicinal drug side-effects, parasites,
                poisons and trauma.
            </p>
            <p>
                Combinations of different herbs are used together to dispel the pathogens and strengthen the body's constitution. Through the effects of the specifically chosen herbs the interior organs become balance and
                return to proper harmony and function.
            </p>
            <p>The art of the professional herbalist takes years of study and experience. The herbs used at our clinic are specifically selected to be of the highest quality to be safe and effective.</p>
